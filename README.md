# R-Scripts
The feed for the scripts is the values which are provided based on di or tri-nucleotide featured models. Nucleotide sequences are analysed using those models. Those values are used to do several calculations and plot accordingly where the scripts are utilized.
DNAcycP-1.R : This script allows calculating the output of the convolutional neural networking (CNN) program - DNAcycP, which provides a c-score value. The further calculation of the values generated according to the sequence and the resultant plotting shows distinctive outcomes.
