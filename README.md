# R-Scripts
The feed for the scripts is the values which are provided based on di or tri-nucleotide featured models. Nucleotide sequences are analysed using those models. Those values are used to do several calculations and plot accordingly. The scripts are written with for-loops and sometimes nesting was also done. The scripts favour automation by calculating, plotting and simultaneously saving within a directory. For every script to be utilized, some changes regarding saving directory has to be done.

DNAcycP-1.R : This script allows calculating the outputs generated by the convolutional neural networking (CNN) program - DNAcycP. Along with further calculations and the resultant plotting allows to reach several distinctive outcomes. Paper link of this CNN program - https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/50/6/3142/6548411

Stat-test-2.R : The equation and package named Wilcoxon Rank Sum test - a non-parametric test, has been utilized to equate the p-value within the plots generated.

Heatmap1.R : This script will allow in-depth customization of building a heatmap with borders around each box.
